CHANDRAYAN 2 , A FAILURE?

Hours passed,India's dream of landing a spacecraft on moon remain unfulfilled. As Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) confirmed that 95% of our objectives have been consumated, nevertheless the communication with Vikram in last few minutes lost. Though the expected soft-landing of the Vikram lander was not accomplished.
ISRO chief Sivan comforted that they are trying their best to establish connection again.He also confirmed that it was not all loss.
The whole world was getting an eye on the mission to be completed.
We cannot say that it was completely a failure but it was not up to the mark we expected. Our scientists are still trying their best for the maximum profit.
